SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Paperwork Reduction Act
The collection of information con- tained in these final regulations has been reviewed and approved by the Office of Management and Budget in accor- dance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507) under control num- ber 1545–1897. The collection of in- formation in these final regulations is in §48.4081–3(c)(2)(iii) and (iv). This collection of information allows certain importers of record and sureties to avoid liability for the tax on the entry of taxable fuel into the United States.
An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a valid control number assigned by the Of- fice of Management and Budget.
The estimated annual burden per re- spondent and/or recordkeeper varies from 15 minutes to 2.25 hours, depending on in-
Linda E. Stiff,
fuel, other importers of record, and certain sureties.
DATES: Effective Date: These regulations are effective July 27, 2007.
Applicability Dates: For dates of applicability, see §§48.4081–1(f) and 48.4081–3(j).

Books or records relating to this col- lection of information must be retained as long as their contents may become mate- rial in the administration of any internal revenue law. Generally, tax returns and tax return information are confidential, as re- quired by 26 U.S.C. 6103.
Background
This document amends the Manufac- turers and Retailers Excise Tax Regula- tions (26 CFR part 48) to provide rules relating to the tax that section 4081 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) im- poses on the entry of taxable fuel into the United States. On July 30, 2004, a temporary regulation (T.D. 9145, 2004–2 C.B. 464 [69 FR 45587]) relating to this topic was published in the Federal Reg- ister. A notice of proposed rulemaking (REG–120616–03, 2004–2 C.B. 474 [69 FR 45631]) cross-referencing the tempo- rary regulations was published in the Fed- eral Register on the same day. Written

and electronic comments were received and a public hearing was held on January 12, 2005. After considering the written comments and the comments made at the public hearing, the proposed regulations are adopted as revised by this Treasury de- cision, and the corresponding temporary regulations are removed.
The temporary and proposed regula- tions. Effective September 28, 2004, the temporary regulations provide that the im- porter of record (under Customs law) of taxable fuel is jointly and severally liable with the enterer for the tax imposed on the entry of taxable fuel if the importer of record is not the enterer (that is, the im- porter of record is a customs broker en- gaged by the enterer) and the enterer is not a taxable fuel registrant. Under the law in effect before September 28, 2004, an importer of record’ s Customs bond could have been charged for any unpaid tax im- posed on the entry of fuel imported under the bond. The preamble of the temporary regulations stated, however, that the IRS would not charge the Customs bond for the tax imposed on an entry of fuel occurring before September 28, 2004. In addition, the temporary regulations provide that the Customs bond posted with respect to the importation of fuel will not be charged for the tax imposed on an entry of fuel oc- curring after September 27, 2004, if the enterer is a taxable fuel registrant or the surety believes, based on the enterer’s cer- tification, that the enterer is a taxable fuel registrant.
Public comments. One commenta- tor that represents an association of road builders supported the proposed and tem- porary regulations, calling them one of a series of important initiatives necessary to combat fuel tax evasion and finance the Highway Trust Fund.
Several commentators that represent tribal interests in the state of New York opposed the regulations. They maintained that the regulations will cause fuel prices to increase at service stations located on tribal reservations. These higher fuel prices will reduce sales and result in the loss of several hundred tribal jobs. In addition, a reduction in sales at these sta- tions would cause a decrease in receipts from the tribal tax on fuel sold on the reservations. This tax funds general tribal
government services, including police, health, and welfare programs.
Many of these commentators also sug- gested that the Treasury Department and the IRS failed to comply with section 5 of Executive Order 13175 (65 FR 6724) and Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735), which generally requires each Federal agency to consult with tribal officials be- fore the promulgation of any regulation that “has tribal implications” or that “im- poses substantial direct compliance costs on Indian tribal governments.”
The final regulations. This Treasury decision adopts the proposed rules as final regulations without substantive change. Because the cross-reference notice of proposed rulemaking referred to the text of temporary rules, the Treasury deci- sion includes the nonsubstantive, clerical changes needed to incorporate the tempo- rary rule text into the final regulations.
The rules in these regulations address the nonpayment of tax on fuel that is en- tered into the United States. An enterer’s failure to pay this tax not only gives it a competitive price advantage over its com- pliant competitors, but it also deprives the United States Treasury of revenue in- tended for the Highway Trust Fund. The final regulations do not impose a new tax burden on enterers of taxable fuel. In- stead, the regulations simply provide the IRS with an additional enforcement tool to collect the tax that is owed under existing law and give an additional incentive for enterers to be registered.
The imposition of tax on the entry of fuel sold on reservations results not from these regulations but from the statute, which does not provide an exemption from the tax for fuel sold on reservations. The only effect of these regulations is to improve the ability of the IRS to apply the tax consistently and fairly with respect to all taxpayers subject to the tax, without regard to whether or not the fuel is ulti- mately sold on tribal reservations.
The Treasury Department and IRS de- termined that these regulations are not subject to Executive Order 13175 (65 FR 67249) which obligates an agency to con- sult with tribal officials when developing “policies that have tribal implications.” This executive order defines “policies that have tribal implications,” in part, as regu- lations that have substantial direct effects
on one or more Indian tribes. The regu- lations do not have tribal implications, as specified in Executive Order 13175, be- cause they do not significantly or uniquely affect the communities of Indian tribal governments, nor do they impose direct compliance costs on them. Any economic effect of the fuel tax on tribal economies is a consequence of the statutory imposition of the tax, not the manner in which the reg- ulations operate to implement the statute. Thus, Executive Order 13175 does not ap- ply to the final or temporary regulations.
Special Analyses
It has been determined that these regu- lations are not a significant regulatory ac- tion as defined in Executive Order 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Pro- cedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) does not apply to these regulations. It is hereby certified that the collection of information in these regulations will not have a sig- nificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This certifica- tion is based upon the fact that any burden on taxpayers is minimal. Accordingly, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chap- ter 6) is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Code, the notice of proposed rulemaking preceding these final regula- tions was submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Ad- ministration for comment on the impact of the regulations on small business.
Drafting Information
The principal author of these regula- tions is Celia Gabrysh, Office of Associate Chief Counsel (Passthroughs and Special Industries). However, other personnel from the IRS, the Treasury Department, and the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection, Department of Homeland Se- curity, participated in their development.

Section 6402.—Authority to Make Credits or Refunds
26 CFR 301.6402–1: Authority to make credits or refunds.
(Also: Section 6411; 1.6411–3.)
Limitations on setoff under sections 6402 and 6411. This ruling holds that the Service may credit an overpayment against unassessed internal revenue tax liabilities that have been determined in a statutory notice of deficiency sent to the taxpayer. It further holds that under section 6411(b) of the Code, the Service may credit a de- crease in tax resulting from a tentative car- ryback adjustment against unassessed lia- bilities determined in a statutory notice of deficiency. Rev. Rul. 54–378 clarified.
Rev. Rul. 2007–51
ISSUES
(1) Does section 6402(a) of the Code al- low the Service to credit an overpayment against unassessed internal revenue tax li- abilities determined in a notice of defi- ciency?
(2) Does section 6411(b) of the Code al- low the Service to credit a decrease in tax resulting from a tentative carryback adjust- ment against unassessed internal revenue tax liabilities determined in a notice of de- ficiency?
SCOPE
This revenue ruling only applies to in- ternal revenue tax liabilities that are sub- ject to the deficiency procedures of Sub- chapter B of Chapter 63 of the Code. This revenue ruling does not address the ques- tion of the Service’s crediting rights prior to issuing a notice of deficiency, in the context of a termination assessment under section 6851 or otherwise. This revenue
ruling also does not address the Service’s crediting rights when a taxpayer is in bank- ruptcy (or other insolvency) proceedings. See Rev. Rul. 2007–52 (this Bulletin) for the Service’s crediting rights when a tax- payer is in bankruptcy.
FACTS
Situation 1. On March 15, 2005, a cor- porate taxpayer filed its income tax return for the tax year ending December 31, 2004, claiming a refund of $500,000. On April 15, 2005, the Service sent a notice of de- ficiency to the taxpayer for tax year 2003 in the amount of $1,000,000. As of April 15, 2005, the Service had not refunded the $500,000 overpayment for tax year 2004 or assessed the $1,000,000 deficiency for tax year 2003.
Situation 2. On March 15, 2005, a cor- porate taxpayer filed a Form 1139, Cor- poration Application for Tentative Refund, carrying back a net operating loss from tax year 2004 to tax year 2002. The carryback generated a $250,000 decrease in tax for tax year 2002. On April 15, 2005, the Ser- vice sent a notice of deficiency to the tax- payer for tax year 2003 in the amount of $1,000,000. As of April 15, 2005, the Ser- vice had not assessed the $1,000,000 defi- ciency for tax year 2003 or tentatively re- funded the $250,000 decrease in tax for tax year 2002.
LAW
Authority to Make Credits or Refunds
Section 6402(a) provides that within the applicable period of limitations the Secretary may credit the amount of any overpayment, including interest allowed thereon, against any liability in respect of an internal revenue tax on the part of the person who made the overpayment. The Secretary shall refund any balance to the person who made the overpayment, subject to further credit against amounts specified in sections 6402(c), (d), and (e). Regulations under section 6402(a) similarly provide that credit may be made against “any outstanding liability.” See section 301.6402–1 of the Regulations on Procedure and Administration.
Tentative Carryback and Refund Adjustments
Section 6411(a) provides that a tax- payer may file an application for tentative carryback adjustment of the tax for the prior taxable year affected by a net op- erating loss carryback, a business credit carryback, or a capital loss carryback from any taxable year. The application shall be made on Form 1139 or, in the case of tax- payers other than corporations, on Form 1045, and shall set forth in detail the in- formation required by sections 6411(a)(1) through (a)(6) and by section 1.6411–1 of the Income Tax Regulations.
Section 6411(b) provides, in general, that within a period of 90 days from the date of filing the application for tentative carryback adjustment, the Secretary shall make a limited examination of the appli- cation to discover omissions and errors of computation, and shall determine the amount of the decrease in tax attribut- able to the carryback. See also section 1.6411–3(b) of the Income Tax Regula- tions.
Pursuant to section 6411(b) and section 1.6411–3(d), the decrease in tax attribut- able to the carryback shall, in the follow- ing order:
1. be applied under section 1.6411–3(d)(1) against any un- paid amount of the tax with respect to which such decrease was determined (i.e., unpaid tax for the carryback year);
2. be credited under section 1.6411–3(d)(2) against any un- satisfied amount of any tax for the taxable year immediately preceding the taxable year of the net operat- ing loss carryback, business credit carryback, or capital loss carryback, the time for payment of which was extended under section 6164; and
3. be credited under section 1.6411–3(d)(3) against any tax or installment thereof “then due” from the taxpayer, and, if not so credited, be refunded to the taxpayer.
